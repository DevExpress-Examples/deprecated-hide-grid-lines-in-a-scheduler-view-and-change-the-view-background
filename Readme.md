# How to hide grid lines in a Scheduler view and change the view's background

This example demonstrates how to specify a custom background color for cells and hide grid lines in views. To accomplish this task in versions **19.1** and newer, use  a custom [Brush Provider](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/400994/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/appearance-customization?v=19.2#brush-provider). In versions prior to **19.1**, declare a custom [CellStyle](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Scheduling.DayViewBase.CellStyle) as demonstrated in [previous versions of this example](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-hide-grid-lines-in-a-scheduler-view-and-change-the-views-background-t569772/tree/17.2.3+).

## Note
Starting with version **19.2**, the Scheduler control provides an advanced functionality to highlight custom intervals - [Time Regions](). See how to use this feature in this example: [How to highlight intervals in Scheduler](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/details/t590114/how-to-color-time-cells-partially).
